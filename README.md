#### Input Validation is a technique required to mitigate programs vulnerable to attack due to improper input validation. I created a sample vulnerable c++ program and applied proper validation on it so that each test case input is validated before passing into the program

#### However, we do not require all the test cases to test each branch of the program. Test-case suite reduction implements an algorithm basedon branch coverage of various test cases to generate least number of test cases required to completely test the program.
